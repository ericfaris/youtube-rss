"""Human-curated release notes shown in the dashboard's version dialog.

This ships inside the container (unlike git history, which isn't copied into
the image), so it's the source of truth for "what changed in each version".
Keep the newest release first, and update it alongside ``app.__version__``
whenever you cut a release. ``date`` is the release (commit/tag) date.
